# ModalControllerReactJS
Modal Controller made with React framework, JS
Modals are very useful and effective parts of web programming. In this repository I made a modal controller with Wrapper, Manager and Reducer for effective and easy-using modals. 
Modals are also known as dialog or popup. 
Modal is a floating screen item. Has a default OK and CANCEL buttons.
You can configure functions and styles of these buttons and also sizes of modals.
In ModalActions, we have two actions named "openModal" and "closeModal". We utilize their action types in this phase.
We can use dispatch for these actions in functional components or constant functions. If you want to use them in class components, you should work with props, reducer and Redux connect.
